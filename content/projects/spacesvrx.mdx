The 3D Display Room is built with Next.js and utilizes SpacesVR, a library that enables the creation of immersive VR experiences directly in the browser. It provides a seamless way to integrate 3D models and VR interactions into web applications.

In the virtual room, you will find various 3D components that you can interact with. Feel free to move around the room and explore the objects from different angles. When you click on the scooter 3D model, it will redirect you to my portfolio site, jrhunor.com, where you can learn more about my projects and work.
